"git push --force"
this will push even if  you change the history
like you pull and then do rebase -i and push this
not allowing because you change the history that 
in the remote but now you can

"git push --force-with-lease"
will check first if the last commmit in the remote is 
yours so you dont delete work of any body else
VERY VERY GREAT OPTION
