"git push --force"
this will push even if  you change the history
like you pull and then do rebase -i and push this
not allowing because you change the history that 
in the remote but now you can

"git push --force-with-lease"
will check first if the last commmit in the remote is 
yours so you dont delete work of any body else
VERY VERY GREAT OPTION

"git add -p fileName"
will ask you in each connected chunck of lines if 
you want to add them to staging area or not 
so you can add half of the file to this commit and
another half to the second commit this usefal if there is more
that one edit the same file so you need to take just your
own changes to cur commit
